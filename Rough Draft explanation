I am very excited to illustrate my opinion and stance on the arguement I selected in my visual rhetoric project. As I 
mentioned in my proposal, I want to aruge that more people should adopt dogs from shelters instead of from breeders. I beleive 
that a lot of people tend to forget the dogs that are waiting to be taken home in shelters throughout the world. The background
to my project is a pole on a street with a blank piece of paper. I believe that a lot of people get messages out to the public
by advertising them to people. One of the ways is through posters. Hence why I selected a blank piece of paper on a pole as my 
backgrounf. That way I could place what I wanted to on the piece of paper. I know my project is in the very early stages, but as
you can see in the preview, I placed a couple of pictures of dogs that are still waiting to be adopted, versus dogs that are 
happy in homes. 

I plan to eventually add words to the poster such as "Save a life". I want to add little sentences that are simple, but get 
the idea across. There are a couple things I definitely need to work on such as trying to figure out if I can make the pictures
on the paper smaller. but seeing if there is a way to not make them so blurry. I am also wondering if there is any way I can zoom
in on the piece of paper instead of showing so much of the pole. That way I can focus more on the piece of paper and what I 
place on it more. As I said I am excited to continue to get creative with this project and see where I can take this visual 
rhetoric project.
